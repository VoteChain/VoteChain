About VoteChain

VoteChain is an innovative blockchain-based voting system currently in development, 
designed to redefine the way communities, organizations, and institutions make decisions. 
The platform aims to bring transparency, fairness, and trust to digital voting processes by
integrating democratic principles into a secure, decentralized environment.

VoteChain is being built on the NEAR Protocol to ensure seamless user interaction and enhanced security. 
The system will offer customizable polls, real-time result tracking, and unique features that mirror real-world election systems.


Key Features (In Progress)

1. Poll Creation with Scheduling
Users will be able to create polls and set specific start and stop times, 
allowing better organization and planning of voting events.


2. One-Time Voting with Unique NEAR IDs
Each voter will be able to cast a single vote using their unique NEAR account, 
ensuring that the process is secure and free from multiple voting attempts.


3. Democratic Election Model
VoteChain will allow the creation of political parties or groups and the addition of candidates for each. 
This structure makes the system suitable for elections within communities, organizations, or even political bodies.


4. Real-Time Result Transparency
Voting results will be visible and updated in real time as the poll progresses. 
This feature promotes trust and accountability in the voting process.


5. Secure, Access-Controlled Polls
Poll creators will have the option to lock polls with a passcode, ensuring that only authorized users can access and participate.


6. Accredited Body Polls
VoteChain will also support body-specific polls, where only pre-approved voters can participate. 
This feature is ideal for organizations or communities that need exclusive voting rights for their members.
